      "taskTitle": "Setup Project Structure and Environment",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the setup of a full-stack React/Node.js/MongoDB project into logical phases, including repository initialization, directory structure, dependency installation, environment configuration, and basic frontend/backend integration.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves establishing the foundational architecture for both frontend and backend, configuring environment variables, and ensuring proper communication between components. It requires knowledge of multiple technologies and best practices for scalable project setup, but follows established patterns and is well-documented in the industry.[6][9]"

      "taskTitle": "Implement User Authentication System",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the user authentication system into backend model design, registration/login endpoints, password security, JWT handling, password recovery, profile management, and middleware for route protection.",
      "reasoning": "Authentication systems are inherently complex due to security requirements, token management, password handling, and user data validation. The need for password recovery, persistent sessions, and secure profile management increases both essential and accidental complexity.[3][4]"

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Develop Data Models and CRUD Operations",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the implementation of data models and CRUD operations into model schema design, endpoint creation for each CRUD operation, validation logic, statistics calculation, and position/overdue tracking.",
      "reasoning": "Designing robust data models and implementing full CRUD with validation, statistics, and position management introduces both structural and cognitive complexity. Ensuring data integrity and handling edge cases requires careful planning.[3][5]"

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Create Frontend Authentication Components",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the frontend authentication UI into registration/login forms, password recovery, profile management, state/context management, and protected route implementation.",
      "reasoning": "While the frontend leverages established patterns for authentication flows, integrating context, validation, and protected routes adds moderate complexity. UI/UX consistency and error handling are important but manageable with best practices.[7][10]"

      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Header and Footer Components",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Separate the header and footer implementation into branding, authentication controls, utility features (help, date search, dark mode), and responsive styling.",
      "reasoning": "This task is primarily UI-focused with some state management. While it involves multiple features, each is relatively straightforward and follows standard componentization practices.[7]"

      "taskTitle": "Develop To-Do Card Core Functionality",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the To-Do card into date handling, task list rendering, completion tracking, navigation logic, API integration, and responsive design.",
      "reasoning": "The To-Do card is central to the app, requiring integration of data, UI state, navigation, and real-time updates. Managing task positions, completion, and feedback increases both essential and cognitive complexity.[3][4]"

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Implement Rich Text Editor for Tasks",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the rich text editor implementation into library selection, integration, formatting features, emoticon support, and mobile responsiveness.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating a rich text editor with custom formatting and emoticon support involves third-party libraries and UI/UX considerations. Ensuring data persistence and validation adds moderate complexity.[3]"

      "taskTitle": "Implement Task Priority and Overdue Tracking",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the task into model updates, priority UI, backend logic for overdue tracking, frontend indicators, and sorting/filtering functionality.",
      "reasoning": "Adding priority and overdue tracking requires updates across the stack but leverages existing CRUD and UI patterns. The logic is clear but requires careful coordination between frontend and backend.[3][5]"

      "taskTitle": "Implement Dark Mode and Theme Persistence",
      "complexityScore": 5,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Separate dark mode implementation into theme palette setup, context/state management, persistent storage, and component styling updates.",
      "reasoning": "Theme switching and persistence are well-understood UI tasks. While global styling and persistence add some complexity, the implementation is supported by modern frameworks and libraries.[7]"

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into backend transfer logic, date transition handling, visual indicators, security/hardening, performance optimization, and end-to-end testing.",
      "reasoning": "Automating task transfer involves temporal and structural complexity, requiring robust backend logic, error handling, and comprehensive testing. Security and performance considerations further increase complexity.[3][5]"
